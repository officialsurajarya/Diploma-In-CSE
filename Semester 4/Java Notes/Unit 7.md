# Unit 7: Exception Handling in Java

**Definition of Exception Handling:**
- **Exception handling** is a mechanism in Java that handles runtime errors, so the normal flow of the application can be maintained. It allows you to anticipate and manage errors, ensuring the program doesn’t crash unexpectedly.

**Why Exception Handling is Important:**
- **Improves Program Reliability**: By managing exceptions, programs can recover from errors and continue execution rather than crashing.
- **Cleaner Code**: It separates error handling from the regular code flow, making the program easier to read and maintain.
- **Provides Feedback to the User**: Exception handling allows you to provide meaningful error messages, which can help developers and users diagnose problems.
- **Helps in Debugging**: Using exceptions makes it easier to trace the source of errors and solve them efficiently.
- **Necessary for Robust Applications**: In live projects and production environments, exceptions help in making applications more resilient and less prone to crashes.

### 1. **Implementation of Keywords in Exception Handling**

- **`try`**: The `try` block is used to wrap the code that may throw an exception. If an exception occurs inside the `try` block, it is caught by the corresponding `catch` block.

  ```java
  try {
      int result = 10 / 0;  // ArithmeticException
  }
  ```

- **`catch`**: The `catch` block is used to handle exceptions. It follows the `try` block and is used to specify what should be done when an exception occurs.

  ```java
  try {
      int result = 10 / 0;
  } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
      System.out.println("Error: Division by zero!");
  }
  ```

- **`finally`**: The `finally` block is always executed after the `try` and `catch` blocks, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not. It's used to clean up resources like closing files or database connections.

  ```java
  try {
      int result = 10 / 0;
  } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
      System.out.println("Error: Division by zero!");
  } finally {
      System.out.println("This block is always executed.");
  }
  ```

- **`throw`**: The `throw` keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception. It can be used to throw both built-in and custom exceptions.

  ```java
  throw new ArithmeticException("Custom exception message");
  ```

- **`throws`**: The `throws` keyword is used in method declarations to indicate that a method can throw exceptions. It’s used for checked exceptions that are not handled within the method.

  ```java
  public void readFile(String filename) throws IOException {
      // Code that might throw IOException
  }
  ```

### 2. **Built-in Exceptions**

Java provides many built-in exceptions, which are divided into **checked exceptions** and **unchecked exceptions**.

- **Checked Exceptions**: These are exceptions that must be either caught or declared in the method signature using `throws`. They represent conditions that a program should handle explicitly.
  - Examples: `IOException`, `SQLException`, `FileNotFoundException`, `ClassNotFoundException`.

- **Unchecked Exceptions**: These exceptions are not required to be caught or declared. They typically represent programming errors.
  - Examples: `ArithmeticException`, `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, `IllegalArgumentException`.

  **Example of Built-in Exceptions:**
  ```java
  public class Example {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          try {
              String str = null;
              int length = str.length();  // NullPointerException
          } catch (NullPointerException e) {
              System.out.println("Caught exception: " + e);
          }

          try {
              int result = 10 / 0;  // ArithmeticException
          } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
              System.out.println("Caught exception: " + e);
          }
      }
  }
  ```

### 3. **Creating Own Exception Subclasses**

You can create your own exceptions by extending the `Exception` class (for checked exceptions) or the `RuntimeException` class (for unchecked exceptions).

- **Custom Checked Exception**: 
  ```java
  class InvalidAgeException extends Exception {
      public InvalidAgeException(String message) {
          super(message);  // Pass message to parent class constructor
      }
  }
  ```

- **Custom Unchecked Exception**: 
  ```java
  class InvalidInputException extends RuntimeException {
      public InvalidInputException(String message) {
          super(message);  // Pass message to parent class constructor
      }
  }
  ```

  **Example of Using Custom Exception:**
  ```java
  class InvalidAgeException extends Exception {
      public InvalidAgeException(String message) {
          super(message);
      }
  }

  public class CustomExceptionExample {
      public static void validateAge(int age) throws InvalidAgeException {
          if (age < 18) {
              throw new InvalidAgeException("Age must be at least 18.");
          }
          System.out.println("Age is valid.");
      }

      public static void main(String[] args) {
          try {
              validateAge(15);  // Throws InvalidAgeException
          } catch (InvalidAgeException e) {
              System.out.println(e.getMessage());
          }
      }
  }
  ```

### 4. **Importance of Exception Handling in Practical Implementation of Live Projects**

- **Error Isolation**: Exception handling isolates errors from the main logic of the program. This helps in maintaining the integrity of the system even when unexpected events or errors occur.
- **User-Friendly Programs**: Exception handling allows you to provide informative error messages to users, ensuring they understand the issue and don’t get frustrated.
- **Resource Management**: Exception handling is essential in managing system resources like file handling, database connections, and network connections. By using the `finally` block, you can ensure resources are always released properly.
- **Maintaining Application Flow**: By handling exceptions, you ensure that your application doesn't crash unexpectedly. It provides a smooth flow, allowing the system to respond to errors, log them, and continue execution or stop gracefully.
- **Debugging and Logging**: Exception handling allows logging detailed error messages that help developers debug issues in production environments. It also provides stack traces that are crucial for finding the root cause of problems.
- **Security**: Proper exception handling prevents revealing sensitive information to users, which could be exploited by attackers. By handling exceptions correctly, you can avoid exposing internal program details.

### Example of Practical Implementation in a Live Project:

Imagine you're building an e-commerce platform where customers can place orders. You can use exception handling to manage issues like invalid user input, database connectivity errors, and payment failures.

```java
public class ECommerce {
    public void processOrder(int orderID) throws DatabaseException, PaymentException {
        try {
            // Simulate database operation
            if (orderID < 1) {
                throw new DatabaseException("Invalid order ID.");
            }

            // Simulate payment processing
            if (orderID == 2) {
                throw new PaymentException("Payment failed.");
            }

            System.out.println("Order processed successfully.");
        } catch (DatabaseException | PaymentException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Transaction complete.");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ECommerce app = new ECommerce();
        try {
            app.processOrder(2);  // This will simulate a payment failure
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Unexpected error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}

class DatabaseException extends Exception {
    public DatabaseException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

class PaymentException extends Exception {
    public PaymentException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```
