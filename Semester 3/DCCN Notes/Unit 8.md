# Unit 8: Network Administration

**8.1 Network Security Principles, Cryptography, using secure protocols**  
- **Network Security Principles**: Focuses on ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of data and network resources. The goal is to protect against threats such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and malicious attacks.
- **Cryptography**: The practice of securing communication and data through encryption. It involves converting data into unreadable formats that can only be decrypted by authorized parties. Key concepts include symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and hashing algorithms.
- **Using Secure Protocols**: Secure communication protocols ensure data integrity and confidentiality. Examples include:
  - **HTTPS** (secure version of HTTP) for encrypted web browsing.
  - **SSH** for secure remote server access.
  - **TLS/SSL** for encrypted email transmission and secure connections.

**8.2 Troubleshooting Tools**  
- **PING**: A network diagnostic tool used to test the reachability of a device on a network and measure round-trip time.
- **IPCONFIG (Windows)**: A command-line tool used to display and configure the network interface parameters on a Windows device (e.g., IP address, subnet mask, gateway).
- **IFCONFIG (Linux/macOS)**: Similar to IPCONFIG, but used on Unix-like systems to display and configure network interface parameters.
- **NETSTAT**: Displays network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics. It helps identify active connections and monitor network usage.
- **TRACEROUTE**: A tool to trace the path packets take to reach their destination, useful for identifying network delays and troubleshooting routing issues.
- **Wireshark**: A powerful network protocol analyzer used to capture and inspect data packets on a network. It helps diagnose network problems and identify malicious activities.
- **Nmap**: A network scanning tool used to discover devices and services on a network, including port scanning and security audits.
- **TCPDUMP**: A command-line tool to capture network packets for analysis. It is often used for debugging and troubleshooting network issues.
- **ROUTEPRINT (Windows)**: A command-line tool that shows the routing table on a Windows system, helping to identify routing issues.

**8.3 DHCP Server**  
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**: A network protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network. It reduces manual IP address configuration, improving network management efficiency.
- **DHCP Server**: The server that manages the DHCP process, assigning IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS servers to client devices.

**8.4 Workgroup/Domain Networking**  
- **Workgroup**: A type of local area network (LAN) where each computer is a standalone unit with no central server. Workgroups are suitable for small networks.
- **Domain Networking**: A more structured network configuration where all devices are connected to a central server (Domain Controller). In this setup, centralized authentication, access control, and security management are provided.
