#### **9.1 Introduction to Wireless LAN (WLAN), IEEE 802.11, WiMax, and Li-Fi**

**Wireless LAN (WLAN)**:
- **Definition**: A Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) is a network that allows devices to communicate with each other and access resources wirelessly, typically within a small area like a home, office, or campus.
- **Components**: WLANs consist of **Access Points (APs)** that act as intermediaries between wireless devices (such as laptops, smartphones, etc.) and the wired network.

**IEEE 802.11**:
- **Standard**: **IEEE 802.11** is the family of standards for wireless local area networks (WLANs) and is commonly known as **Wi-Fi**.
- **Sub-standards**: There are several **802.11 standards**, each offering different features, including:
  - **802.11a**: Operates at 5 GHz, with speeds up to **54 Mbps**.
  - **802.11b**: Operates at 2.4 GHz, with speeds up to **11 Mbps**.
  - **802.11g**: Operates at 2.4 GHz, with speeds up to **54 Mbps**.
  - **802.11n**: Supports both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, with speeds up to **600 Mbps**.
  - **802.11ac**: Operates at 5 GHz, with speeds up to **1.3 Gbps**.
  - **802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)**: The latest standard, offering higher efficiency, speeds up to **9.6 Gbps**, and improved capacity.
  
Wi-Fi has become the dominant wireless technology for local networking due to its widespread adoption and reliability.

**WiMax**:
- **Definition**: **WiMax (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access)** is a wireless broadband technology designed for long-range communication, providing high-speed internet access over larger areas.
- **Range and Speed**: WiMax can cover distances of up to **50 km** for fixed applications and **5-15 km** for mobile applications, with speeds ranging from **1 Mbps to 70 Mbps**.
- **Applications**: It is used for **broadband internet** in rural or underserved areas and **backhaul for mobile networks**.

**Li-Fi**:
- **Definition**: **Li-Fi (Light Fidelity)** is a wireless communication technology that uses **visible light** (instead of radio waves) to transmit data.
- **Speed**: Li-Fi can offer **high-speed internet** of up to **10 Gbps** and is immune to interference from radio-frequency signals.
- **Applications**: Li-Fi can be used in places where radio-frequency-based communication (like Wi-Fi) is not suitable, such as in hospitals, aircraft, and underwater networks.

#### **9.2 Wireless Security**

Wireless networks are vulnerable to several security threats due to their open transmission medium. The main types of wireless security mechanisms include:

- **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)**: An older, now insecure protocol used to encrypt data over Wi-Fi. It is vulnerable to attacks like **brute force** and **key cracking**.
- **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)**: WPA is an improvement over WEP, providing stronger encryption using the **TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol)**. It was replaced by WPA2.
- **WPA2**: The most commonly used encryption protocol for Wi-Fi networks. It uses **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** for stronger security and is more resistant to attacks.
- **WPA3**: The latest security protocol for Wi-Fi networks, offering enhanced encryption, **protection against offline dictionary attacks**, and better security for public networks.

Wireless security also includes **network authentication** (ensuring only authorized users connect), **firewalls**, **VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)**, and **intrusion detection/prevention systems** to protect against unauthorized access and attacks.

#### **9.3 Introduction to Bluetooth - Architecture and Applications**

**Bluetooth**:
- **Definition**: Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology designed for communication between devices over short distances (typically up to **100 meters**).
- **Frequency**: Bluetooth operates in the **2.4 GHz ISM band** (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical band).
- **Bluetooth Architecture**:
  - **Devices**: Bluetooth-enabled devices include smartphones, laptops, tablets, speakers, headsets, etc.
  - **Profiles**: Bluetooth uses different profiles to define the specific application or use case. Some common profiles include **A2DP** (Audio Streaming), **HFP** (Hands-Free Profile), and **PAN** (Personal Area Networking).
  - **Topology**: Bluetooth devices communicate in a **piconet** (a small network of devices, with one master device and up to seven active slave devices).
  
**Applications**:
- **Personal Area Networks (PAN)**: Bluetooth is commonly used to create small, short-range networks between devices, such as connecting a keyboard, mouse, or headphones to a computer.
- **File Transfer**: Bluetooth is widely used for sending files between smartphones and other devices.
- **Audio Devices**: Wireless speakers, headsets, and car kits use Bluetooth for wireless audio streaming.
- **IoT (Internet of Things)**: Bluetooth is also used in smart devices like fitness trackers, smart home devices, and sensors.
