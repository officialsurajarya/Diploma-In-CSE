Unit 1: **Fundamental Notations** Overview

**1.1 Problem Solving Concept: Top-Down and Bottom-Up Design, Structured Programming**
- **Problem-Solving Concept**: The approach used to break down a problem into smaller, manageable parts to arrive at a solution.
  - **Top-Down Design**: A method where you start with the broadest view of the problem and break it down into more specific sub-problems. It focuses on identifying the high-level components and progressively breaking them into smaller parts.
  - **Bottom-Up Design**: This method starts with solving smaller sub-problems first and then integrates them to form a complete solution. It focuses on the details before combining them into a larger system.
  
- **Structured Programming**: A programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a program by using control structures like loops, conditionals, and functions. It avoids the use of "goto" statements and encourages breaking down code into modular, reusable blocks.

**1.2 Concept of Data Types, Variables, and Constants**
- **Data Types**: Specify the type of data that can be stored in a variable. Common data types include:
  - **Primitive Data Types**: Such as `int` (integer), `float` (floating point), `char` (character), and `bool` (boolean).
  - **Composite Data Types**: Includes structures, arrays, and classes.
  - **Abstract Data Types (ADT)**: Defined by their behavior (e.g., list, stack, queue) rather than implementation.
  
- **Variables**: Containers for storing data values that can be modified during program execution. Variables are associated with a data type and a name for reference.
  
- **Constants**: Values that cannot be changed once defined. Constants are often used to represent fixed values like mathematical constants (e.g., `pi`).

**1.3 Concept of Pointer Variables and Constants**
- **Pointer Variables**: A variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Instead of directly holding a value, a pointer holds the address of the location where the data is stored.
  - **Pointer Syntax**: In languages like C and C++, a pointer is declared using the asterisk (`*`) symbol (e.g., `int *ptr`).
  - **Dereferencing**: Accessing the value at the memory address stored in the pointer (e.g., `*ptr`).
  
- **Pointer Constants**: A constant pointer refers to a pointer whose value (memory address) cannot be changed after initialization. The value the pointer points to, however, can be modified.
  - Example: `int *const ptr = &a;` (Here, `ptr` cannot point to a different address, but the value of the address it points to can be changed.)

**1.4 Categories of Data Structure**
- **Linear Data Structures**: Elements are stored in a sequential manner.
  - Examples: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- **Non-Linear Data Structures**: Elements are stored in a hierarchical or interconnected manner.
  - Examples: Trees, Graphs
- **Homogeneous Data Structures**: All elements are of the same data type.
  - Example: Arrays
- **Heterogeneous Data Structures**: Elements can be of different data types.
  - Example: Structures, Unions
