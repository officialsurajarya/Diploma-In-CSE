### Unit 6: Architecture of Multi-Processor Systems

Multi-processor systems are configurations where multiple processors work together to perform computations in parallel. These systems can enhance performance and reliability by distributing computational tasks among several processors.

#### **6.1 Forms of Parallel Processing**

Parallel processing refers to the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks or processes to solve a problem faster. There are several forms of parallel processing:

- **Bit-level Parallelism**: Involves processing multiple bits simultaneously. This is achieved by using wide data paths, where multiple bits can be processed in parallel at the hardware level. For example, using 64-bit instead of 32-bit processors.

- **Instruction-level Parallelism**: Refers to the ability of a processor to execute multiple instructions in parallel. Modern processors can execute multiple instructions simultaneously by breaking them down into simpler operations and using techniques like pipelining and superscalar execution.

- **Task-level Parallelism**: Involves executing multiple tasks or processes at the same time. This can be achieved by dividing a program into smaller subtasks that can run independently and simultaneously. This is commonly used in multi-core processors, where each core executes a different task.

- **Data-level Parallelism**: Refers to the parallel processing of data. It is often used in vector processors or SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) systems, where the same operation is performed on large sets of data in parallel.

- **Thread-level Parallelism**: Involves the parallel execution of threads in a multi-threaded program. Multiple threads can run simultaneously, often on different processors or cores, to perform different parts of the program concurrently.

#### **6.2 Parallel Processing and Pipelines: Basic Characteristics of Multiprocessor Systems**

- **Parallel Processing**: In parallel processing systems, multiple processors work together on the same problem by splitting it into smaller tasks. These processors may share memory (shared memory system) or work with their own local memory (distributed memory system). 

  - **Shared Memory Systems**: All processors share the same memory space, allowing them to directly communicate and access data. This model is easy to program but may have bottlenecks due to contention for the shared memory.
  
  - **Distributed Memory Systems**: Each processor has its own private memory, and processors communicate by passing messages. These systems are scalable and provide better performance for large-scale applications.

- **Pipelining**: Pipelining is a form of parallel processing where multiple stages of a task are executed in overlapping time periods. Each processor or functional unit is dedicated to a specific task in a pipeline, and data flows through these stages. It is commonly used in tasks like instruction processing in CPUs and data processing in multi-stage networks.
  
  - **Pipelining Example**: In a CPU, different stages of instruction execution (fetch, decode, execute) are carried out by different units in parallel to improve overall throughput.

- **Basic Characteristics of Multiprocessor Systems**:
  - **Concurrency**: Multiprocessor systems support the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks, improving throughput and performance.
  - **Scalability**: The ability to add more processors without significantly degrading performance.
  - **Fault Tolerance**: With multiple processors, the failure of one processor doesn’t stop the entire system from functioning, offering greater reliability.
  - **Speedup**: The performance increase from using multiple processors to solve a problem is ideally linear, meaning that doubling the number of processors should ideally halve the time to complete a task.

#### **6.3 General Purpose Multiprocessors**

General-purpose multiprocessors are systems designed to execute a wide variety of tasks using multiple processors. These systems typically consist of a central control unit and several processors connected via shared memory or interconnection networks.

- **Shared Memory Multiprocessors**: All processors have access to a common memory space. These systems are easier to program because processors can communicate via memory reads and writes. However, contention for memory can become a bottleneck as the number of processors increases.
  
- **Distributed Memory Multiprocessors**: Each processor has its own private memory, and processors communicate by passing messages over a network. These systems scale better and are used in high-performance computing environments.

- **Hybrid Systems**: Some systems combine both shared and distributed memory architectures to take advantage of the benefits of both.

#### **6.4 Interconnection Networks**

Interconnection networks are the systems used to connect processors in a multiprocessor system. The choice of interconnection method affects the system's performance, scalability, and fault tolerance.

- **Time-Shared Common Bus**:
  - In a time-shared bus system, multiple processors share a single communication bus. However, only one processor can communicate at a time, and the bus must be shared. This method is simple but can create bottlenecks as the number of processors increases.

- **Multi-Port Memory**:
  - Multi-port memory systems provide multiple data ports, allowing multiple processors to access the memory simultaneously. This can increase performance by reducing memory access contention, but it’s more complex and expensive than a simple shared bus.

- **Crossbar Switch**:
  - A **crossbar switch** connects each processor to each memory module directly, using a network of cross-points (switches). This allows for simultaneous communication between processors and memory but may become costly and complex for large systems.

- **Multi-Stage Switching Networks**:
  - These networks use a series of switches to connect processors and memory. Each processor sends its data to an intermediate stage, which then routes it to the appropriate memory location. This method is more scalable and can reduce congestion compared to direct connections but is more complex.

- **Hypercube Structures**:
  - In a **hypercube network**, processors are arranged in a structure that can be represented as a multidimensional cube. Each processor is connected to other processors in a way that enables efficient communication. This structure is scalable and efficient for large systems but may be complex to implement.
