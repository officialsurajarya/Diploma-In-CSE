# Unit 4: Requirement Analysis and Specification

Requirement analysis and specification are critical stages in the software development process, where the needs of the stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and formally documented to guide the entire project. This phase ensures that the system being developed aligns with the client's expectations and provides the foundation for design and implementation.

#### **4.1 Requirement Gathering and Analysis**

**Requirement Gathering** refers to the process of collecting information about the system that needs to be developed. It involves understanding the goals of the system, the needs of the users, and any constraints that must be considered during the development process.

**Methods of Requirement Gathering:**
- **Interviews**: Direct discussions with stakeholders (users, clients, developers) to understand their needs.
- **Surveys/Questionnaires**: Structured forms to gather information from a large group of stakeholders.
- **Document Analysis**: Reviewing existing documentation (e.g., previous systems, regulatory guidelines) to understand the requirements.
- **Observations**: Observing users’ current workflows and systems to identify areas for improvement.
- **Workshops**: Collaborative meetings with stakeholders to brainstorm and define system requirements.

**Requirement Analysis** refers to the process of analyzing the gathered requirements to ensure they are clear, complete, and feasible. This phase typically involves:
- Identifying the system’s functional and non-functional requirements.
- Analyzing and resolving conflicts or ambiguities in the requirements.
- Prioritizing requirements based on importance and feasibility.
- Establishing clear, measurable criteria for system success.

**Key Goals of Requirement Analysis**:
- Define **what** the system must do (functional requirements).
- Define **how well** the system must perform its functions (non-functional requirements).
- Ensure alignment with business objectives and user needs.
- Clarify the boundaries of the system to prevent scope creep.

#### **4.2 Software Requirement Specifications (SRS)**

A **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** is a formal document that describes the functional and non-functional requirements of the software system to be developed. It serves as a blueprint for the development team and a contract between the stakeholders and the developers.

**Contents of an SRS document typically include**:
1. **Introduction**: Overview of the software, its objectives, and its intended audience.
2. **System Overview**: A brief description of the system, its context, and high-level functionality.
3. **Functional Requirements**: A detailed description of the system’s features and behaviors, often presented as use cases or user stories.
4. **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, usability, scalability, and other system attributes.
5. **System Models**: Diagrams (e.g., use case diagrams, data flow diagrams) that provide a visual representation of the system.
6. **Interface Requirements**: Descriptions of how the software will interact with other systems, hardware, or users.
7. **Assumptions and Constraints**: Assumptions about the system or environment, and any constraints that the development team must work within.
8. **Acceptance Criteria**: Conditions that must be met for the system to be accepted by the client or stakeholders.
9. **Glossary**: Definitions of terms and acronyms used in the document.

**Importance of SRS**:
- Serves as the foundation for system design and development.
- Provides a clear and agreed-upon specification for both the developers and the clients.
- Helps in testing and validating the final system.
- Acts as a reference document for maintenance and future updates.

#### **4.3 Characteristics of a Good SRS**

A **good SRS** document should have several key characteristics to ensure it is clear, effective, and useful throughout the development process:

1. **Correct**:
   - The SRS should accurately reflect the needs and requirements of the stakeholders.
   - It should be validated with users and other stakeholders to ensure it correctly represents their expectations.

2. **Unambiguous**:
   - Each requirement in the SRS should have only one interpretation.
   - Ambiguous statements should be avoided or clarified.

3. **Complete**:
   - The SRS should capture all relevant requirements, including functional and non-functional aspects of the system.
   - It should also cover every scenario and edge case that the system must handle.

4. **Consistent**:
   - There should be no conflicts or contradictions between the requirements.
   - For example, a requirement stating "the system must respond in less than 2 seconds" should not contradict another requirement for performance.

5. **Modifiable**:
   - The document should be easy to update or modify if the requirements change.
   - It should be organized and structured in a way that allows for easy revisions without affecting other parts of the document.

6. **Traceable**:
   - Each requirement should be uniquely identified and traceable to the source of the requirement (e.g., customer request, regulatory standards).
   - Traceability ensures that every requirement can be traced through the stages of development and testing.

7. **Verifiable**:
   - The requirements should be testable so that they can be verified during the system testing phase.
   - For example, specifying "The system shall process 100 transactions per second" is verifiable through testing.

8. **Prioritized**:
   - Not all requirements are equally important. The SRS should prioritize requirements based on their importance and impact on the system.
   - This helps the development team focus on the most critical features first.

9. **Understandable**:
   - The document should be written in clear, straightforward language.
   - It should be understandable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

10. **Traceability**:
    - The SRS should allow tracking of each requirement through the project lifecycle, including design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.
